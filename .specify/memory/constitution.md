# Thesis Agents Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Keep it simple
Clear and minimal project setup, avoid overengineering.

### 2. Modular structure
Each agent in its own file/module, orchestrator coordinates them.

### 3. Readability over complexity
Clean Python code, intuitive folder layout.

### 4. Transparent orchestration
LangGraph is used for agent coordination, with basic logging.

### 5. UI-first
Chainlit provides a simple interface for interaction.

### 6. Robust but lightweight
Include basic error handling and tracing hooks, no unnecessary frameworks.

### 7. Extensible foundation
The project should be easy to expand later with more advanced agent logic.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development, tooling, and agent behavior must align with it. Amendments require a documented proposal, review, and approval process.
