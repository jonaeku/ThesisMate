# Tasks: Base Project for Thesis Agents

**Input**: Design documents from `/Users/I743107/ThesisMate/specs/001-create-a-base/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [X] T001 Create the project structure as defined in `plan.md`.
- [X] T002 Initialize the project with `uv` and create a `pyproject.toml` file.
- [X] T003 Add the following dependencies to `pyproject.toml`: `langgraph`, `chainlit`, `langchain`, `openai`, `openrouter-api-client`, `pydantic`.
- [X] T004 Create a `README.md` file with a brief project description.
- [X] T005 Create a `.env.example` file with placeholders for API keys.

## Phase 3.2: Core Implementation
- [X] T006 [P] In `src/models/models.py`, define the Pydantic models: `TopicSuggestion`, `ResearchSummary`, and `OutlineSection` as specified in `data-model.md`.
- [X] T007 [P] In `src/agents/topic_scout.py`, create the `TopicScoutAgent` class with a `respond` method that returns a list of `TopicSuggestion` objects.
- [X] T008 [P] In `src/agents/research.py`, create the `ResearchAgent` class with a `respond` method that returns a list of `ResearchSummary` objects.
- [X] T009 [P] In `src/agents/structure.py`, create the `StructureAgent` class with a `respond` method that returns an `OutlineSection` object.
- [X] T010 [P] In `src/agents/writing.py`, create the `WritingAssistantAgent` class with a `respond` method that returns a placeholder string.
- [X] T011 [P] In `src/agents/reviewer.py`, create the `ReviewerAgent` class with a `respond` method that returns a placeholder string.
- [X] T012 In `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`, create the `Orchestrator` class with a `run` method that uses LangGraph to coordinate the agents in sequence.
- [X] T013 In `src/ui/app.py`, create a Chainlit application that connects to the `Orchestrator`.
- [X] T014 In `src/utils/logging.py`, configure basic Python logging.
- [X] T015 In `src/utils/config.py`, create a function to load environment variables from the `.env` file.

## Phase 3.3: Integration & Testing
- [X] T016 Integrate the logging and config utilities into the agents and orchestrator.
- [X] T017 Create a basic test in `tests/test_orchestrator.py` to run the orchestrator with dummy agents and verify that it returns a placeholder response.
- [X] T018 Manually run the Chainlit application and verify that the UI is displayed correctly.
