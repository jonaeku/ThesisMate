# Implementation Plan: Base Project for Thesis Agents

**Branch**: `001-create-a-base` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/I743107/ThesisMate/specs/001-create-a-base/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the creation of a skeleton for the "Thesis Agents" multi-agent system. It establishes the project structure, defines the core components, and sets up the initial dependencies. The focus is on creating a clear and extensible foundation for future development.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: LangGraph, Chainlit, LangChain, OpenRouter, Pydantic
**Package Manager**: uv
**Storage**: N/A (for now)
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Local development
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A (skeleton project)
**Constraints**: Keep the structure lean and clear, focus on skeleton code, and allow for quick onboarding.
**Scale/Scope**: Initial multi-agent system skeleton.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1.  **Simplicity**: Yes, the proposed solution uses a clear and minimal setup.
2.  **Modularity**: Yes, the new functionality is encapsulated within distinct agents and modules.
3.  **Readability**: Yes, the code will be clean and the structure intuitive.
4.  **Transparent Orchestration**: Yes, the plan leverages LangGraph for coordination and includes logging.
5.  **UI-First**: Yes, the Chainlit interface is considered in the design.
6.  **Robustness**: Yes, the plan includes basic error handling and tracing.
7.  **Extensibility**: Yes, the design is easy to expand upon later.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
No research is needed as the technical stack and architecture are clearly defined in the feature specification.

**Output**: `research.md`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
1.  **Entities**: The key entities are `TopicSuggestion`, `ResearchSummary`, and `OutlineSection`.
2.  **API Contracts**: N/A for this project as it is not a web service.
3.  **Contract Tests**: N/A.
4.  **Test Scenarios**: The user scenarios from the spec will be used to create integration tests.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
The `/tasks` command will generate a `tasks.md` file with a detailed breakdown of the implementation steps.
