The globally growing number of digital population every day possesses a significant threat to online data including the medical and patients data. After bitcoin, blockchain technology has emerged into a general-purpose technology with applications in medical industries and healthcare. Blockchain can promote highly configurable openness while retaining the highest security standards for critical data of medical patients. Referred to as distributed record keeping for healthcare systems which makes digital assets unalterable and transparent via a cryptographic hash and decentralized network. The study delves into the security and safety improvement associated with implementing blockchain in AI-based healthcare systems. Blockchain-enabled AI tackles the existing issues related to security, performance efficiencies, and safety in healthcare systems. We have also examined the Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and medical industry, potential areas, open questions concerning the blockchain in healthcare systems. Finally, the article proposed an AI-based healthcare blockchain model (healthAIChain) to improve patients data and security.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological and economic developments have transformed the healthcare sector towards more personalized and IoT-based healthcare services. These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that are typically developed using artificial intelligence/machine learning-based algorithms, which play a significant role in highlighting the efficiency of traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are dedicated to a specific environment to support technological personalization. However, they are unable to consider different interrelated health conditions, leading to inappropriate diagnoses and affecting sustainability and the long-term health of patients. To this end, current Healthcare 5.0 technology has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of healthcare 5.0 is to achieve an autonomous healthcare service, that takes into account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services. In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of comprehensive personalized healthcare services in modern healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using AI and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions. Finally, we propose a methodology to develop reliable, resilient, and personalized healthcare services that address the identified weaknesses of existing approaches.",

We compare these themes to the World Health Organization's (WHO) regulatory considerations and principles on ethical use of AI for healthcare applications. Our work seeks to take a global perspective on AI policy by analyzing 14 legal jurisdictions including countries representative of various regions in the world (North America, South America, South East Asia, Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the Asia-Pacific). Our eventual goal is to foster a global conversation on the ethical use of AI in healthcare and the regulations that will guide it.

Current security and privacy (S&P) research on healthcare AI is highly unbalanced in terms of healthcare deployment scenarios and threat models, and has a disconnected focus with the biomedical research community. This hinders a comprehensive understanding of the risks that healthcare AI entails. To address this gap, this paper takes a thorough examination of existing healthcare AI S&P research, providing a unified framework that allows the identification of under-explored areas. Our survey presents a systematic overview of healthcare AI attacks and defenses, and points out challenges and research opportunities for each AI-driven healthcare application domain.

Such improvements are essential in resource-constrained settings where millions lack access to adequate healthcare services, such as in Africa. AI in such a context can potentially improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and accessibility of healthcare services. Nevertheless, the development and use of AI-driven healthcare systems raise numerous ethical, legal, and socio-economic issues. Justice is a major concern in AI that has implications for amplifying social inequities. This paper discusses these implications and related justice concepts such as solidarity, Common Good, sustainability, AI bias, and fairness. For Africa to effectively benefit from AI, these principles should align with the local context while balancing the risks.

First, we present preliminaries to IoT-based healthcare systems, FL in conventional healthcare, and Metaverse healthcare. The benefits of FL in Metaverse healthcare are then discussed, from improved privacy and scalability, better interoperability, better data management, and extra security to automation and low-latency healthcare services. Subsequently, we discuss several applications pertaining to FL-enabled Metaverse healthcare, including medical diagnosis, patient monitoring, medical education, infectious disease, and drug discovery.

    "abstract": "Generative AI holds immense promise in addressing global healthcare access challenges, with numerous innovative applications now ready for use across various healthcare domains. However, a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of these domain-specific AI solutions is the lack of robust safety mechanisms to effectively manage issues such as hallucination, misinformation, and ensuring truthfulness. Left unchecked, these risks can compromise patient safety and erode trust in healthcare AI systems. While general-purpose frameworks like Llama Guard are useful for filtering toxicity and harmful content, they do not fully address the stringent requirements for truthfulness and safety in healthcare contexts. This paper examines the unique safety and security challenges inherent to healthcare AI, particularly the risk of hallucinations, the spread of misinformation, and the need for factual accuracy in clinical settings. I propose enhancements to existing guardrails frameworks, such as Nvidia NeMo Guardrails, to better suit healthcare-specific needs. By strengthening these safeguards, I aim to ensure the secure, reliable, and accurate use of AI in healthcare, mitigating misinformation risks and improving patient safety.",

DeepSeek has emerged as a leading AI system, widely deployed across China's tertiary hospitals since January 2025. Initially implemented in Shanghai's major medical institutions, it has since expanded nationwide, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, streamlining workflows, and improving patient management. AI-powered pathology, imaging analysis, and clinical decision support systems have demonstrated significant potential in optimizing medical processes and reducing the cognitive burden on healthcare professionals. However, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare raises critical regulatory and ethical challenges, particularly regarding accountability in AI-assisted diagnosis and the risk of automation bias. The absence of a well-defined liability framework underscores the need for policies that ensure AI functions as an assistive tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker. With continued technological advancements, AI is expected to integrate multimodal data sources, such as genomics and radiomics, paving the way for precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies.
