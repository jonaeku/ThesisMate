<!-- title: Global Perspectives and Collaborations for AI in Healthcare -->
<!-- citations:  -->
The integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has become a crucial aspect of modern medical practice, transforming the way healthcare services are delivered and received (Mahyuddin K. M. Nasution, Rahmat Hidayat, et al. 2022). A world without AI in healthcare would likely be characterized by inefficient diagnosis and treatment processes, as well as a lack of personalized patient care (Jan Bouda, Lukáš Holík, et al. 2016). The collaboration between global healthcare professionals and AI researchers is essential for the development of effective AI-powered healthcare solutions (Wilhelm Hasselbring, Leslie Carr, et al. 2019). Current research in computer science, as evident in the works of prominent authors ranked by Atharva Rasane (2024), highlights the significance of AI in improving healthcare outcomes. The application of AI in healthcare is a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing debates and discussions, such as those presented in Oxford-style debates (Marcin Niemiec 2022), shaping the future of medical practice. As noted by Manh Cuong Pham, Ralf Klamma, et al. (2011), the development of computer science disciplines, including AI, is critical for addressing complex healthcare challenges. Ultimately, the effective integration of AI in healthcare relies on continued global collaborations and research efforts, leading to improved patient care and outcomes, subba.
