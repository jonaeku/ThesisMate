# Conversation Summary - Research & Topic Scout Agent Planning

**Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Participants**: User, Cline AI Assistant  
**Outcome**: Complete implementation plan for Research & Topic Scout agents

## User Requirements (Key Decisions)

1. **Keep It Simple**: No overengineering, clean and readable code
2. **Free APIs**: Google Scholar, arXiv, Semantic Scholar (no paid services)
3. **Conversational Interface**: All interactions should be natural conversations
4. **Local JSON Storage**: Papers stored locally with links and BibTeX entries
5. **Agent Collaboration**: Topic Scout and Research Agent work together to validate topics
6. **Basic BibTeX**: Simple citation management and export
7. **Minimal Files**: Not too many files, not too complex classes

## Architecture Decision

**Original Plan**: Complex tool-based architecture with abstractions  
**Final Decision**: Simple, direct approach with minimal abstractions

```
Agent → Simple API calls → JSON storage
```

## What We're Building

### Core Components
1. **Enhanced Pydantic Models**: Paper, TopicEvaluation, ConversationState
2. **Simple Storage Functions**: JSON save/load, BibTeX export
3. **Academic API Functions**: Direct API calls to arXiv, Semantic Scholar
4. **Enhanced Agents**: Research Agent and Topic Scout Agent with real implementations

### File Structure
```

├── models/models.py (enhanced with new models)
├── utils/
│   ├── storage.py (new - JSON storage functions)
│   └── academic_apis.py (new - API calls)
├── agents/

│   └── topic_scout.py (enhanced)
└── orchestrator/orchestrator.py (updated)
data/ (new directory for JSON files)
```

## Implementation Timeline

- **Day 1**: Foundation (models, storage, APIs)
- **Day 2-3**: Research Agent implementation
- **Day 3-4**: Topic Scout Agent implementation  
- **Day 4-5**: Integration and testing

## Key Principles Established

1. **Working First**: Get it working, then optimize
2. **Readable Code**: Clear variable names, simple logic
3. **No Abstractions**: Direct API calls, simple functions
4. **JSON Everything**: Simple file-based storage
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Use existing libraries in pyproject.toml

## Success Metrics

- Topic Scout can discover 3-5 validated thesis topics through conversation
- Research Agent can collect 20+ relevant papers with gap analysis
- Agents work together seamlessly
- Natural conversation flow with research-backed suggestions
- Proper BibTeX export and paper organization

## Files Created

1. `docs/research-topic-scout-plan.md` - Overall implementation plan
2. `docs/simple-implementation-guide.md` - Code structure and examples
3. `docs/implementation-tasks.md` - Step-by-step task breakdown
4. `docs/conversation-summary.md` - This summary

## Next Steps

When ready to implement, start with Phase 1 tasks:
1. Enhance data models
2. Create storage functions
3. Create academic API functions
4. Test each component as you build

This approach ensures you get working agents quickly without overengineering the solution.
