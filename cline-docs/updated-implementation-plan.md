# Updated Implementation Plan - Research & Topic Scout Agents

**Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: In Progress - Phase 1  
**APIs Confirmed**: arXiv, CrossRef, Semantic Scholar

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1) - ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ Enhanced Data Models (`src/models/models.py`)
2. ✅ Storage Utilities (`src/utils/storage.py`)
3. ✅ Academic API Utilities (`src/utils/academic_apis.py`)

**Test Results:**
- arXiv + CrossRef APIs working
- Found 4 unique papers from 6 total results
- JSON storage and loading working
- Paper models with all fields working

### Phase 2: Research Agent (Day 2-3) - ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ LLM-powered Research Agent (`src/agents/research.py`)
2. ✅ Paper collection with relevance scoring
3. ✅ Topic evaluation functionality
4. ✅ Deep research analysis methods

**Test Results:**
- Research Agent working with OpenRouter LLM
- Paper collection: Found 4 papers, scored relevance (top paper: 1.00)
- Topic evaluation: Feasibility scoring working
- JSON storage integration working
- Papers saved to `data/papers_neural_networks.json`

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Chainlit UI running at http://localhost:8000
- ✅ OpenRouter API working (successful LLM calls)
- ✅ Research Agent integrated into chat interface
- ✅ Orchestrator routes research queries to Research Agent
- ✅ Paper links included in results

**Completed Integration:**
- Simple keyword-based routing for research queries
- Research Agent returns formatted results with:
  - Paper title and year
  - Authors (top 3)
  - Relevance score
  - Direct links to papers

### Phase 3: Topic Scout Agent (Day 3-4)
- Conversational flow implementation
- Topic validation using Research Agent
- Conversation state management

### Phase 4: Integration (Day 4-5)
- Connect agents in orchestrator
- Test full system with Chainlit
- BibTeX export functionality

## API Configuration

**No Auth Required:**
- arXiv API (3 second rate limit)
- CrossRef API (50 req/sec limit)

**Free Registration:**
- Semantic Scholar API (optional key for higher rate limits)

## Current Task: Step 1.1 - Enhanced Data Models
Adding Paper, TopicEvaluation, and ConversationState models to existing models.py
